# Moving-eyes

Description: Using primarliy HTML and CSS, these eyes were built to follow your every move... This is an example of animating the webpage. 

How to run: Dowload the zip file to your computer locally and load the bigEyes.html file into your browser.

Future improvement: I think this was mostly a fun exercise to learm how to animate on a webpage with html and css. I will build upon these skills further to someday builld a more interactive game.
